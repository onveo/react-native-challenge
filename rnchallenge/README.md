    ** as much as possible i tried to not use packages. 
    for example i didnt use vector icons that you suggested, instead ı used basic text characters
    but when app gets bigger we have to use normal icon sets 

    *** ı prefered functional components generally. 
    if you ask for class based components ı can quickly prepare it as well 

    *** ı prefered to use redux as state manager, ı want to add redux-thunk as well. 
    but we could also use normal state management as well

    *** need to add and remove more codes

    ** could'nt find good for images so i used static images instead of dynamics, 
    this can be easly changed when it requires or when good apis found.
